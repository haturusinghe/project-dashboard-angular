**User Story:**

As a user, I want to upgrade the frontend and backend to enable easier implementation of new features.

**User/Data Flow:**

1. User navigates to the Dashboard page:
   - Fetches the Top Projects list from the backend using Angular's HTTP service.
   - Displays the Top Projects on the dashboard.

2. Fetch Completed Projects from the backend:
   - Displays an alert for completed projects on the dashboard.

3. User clicks on the "Go to Project List" button to navigate to the Project List page:
   - Fetches the project list from the backend using Angular's HTTP service.
   - Displays the project list on the dedicated page.

4. User clicks on the "Add new Project" button to navigate to the Save Project page:
   - Submits a form with new project data through Angular's form handling.
   - Validates user input both client-side and server-side.
   - Sends the new project data to the backend using Angular's HTTP service.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The upgraded frontend should be implemented using Angular (version X.X).
2. The upgraded backend should be implemented using Node.js (version X.X).
3. The upgraded system should maintain the functionality of existing features.
4. Comprehensive error handling is in place for all frontend-backend interactions.
5. Edge cases, such as failed backend requests, are handled gracefully to inform the user.

**Subtasks:**

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the subtasks based on your request:

**Subtasks:**

1. Set up a new Angular project using Angular CLI.
2. Create new Service in Angular to handle HTTP requests to the backend.
3. Create a new Angular component dedicated to displaying a list of projects on a separate page.
4. Implement the functionality to delete a project from the project list within the dedicated page component.
5. Create a new Angular component for the dashboard to showcase the top projects.
6. Implement the feature to display alerts for completed projects within the dashboard component.
7. Develop a new Angular component for the Save Project page to facilitate the addition of a new project.
